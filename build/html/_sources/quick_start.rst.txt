## Basic Usage: 4 pillars of Selene

All Selene API consists just from 4 pillars:

1. Browser Actions (including finding elements)
2. Custom Selectors
3. Assertion Conditions
4. Custom Configuration

And one more not mandatory bonus:

5. Concise jquery-style shortcuts for finding elements

All pillars are reflected in corresponding selene python modules and their methods.
