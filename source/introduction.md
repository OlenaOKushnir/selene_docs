(Selenide port in Python)

We have really easy and effective tool for Web UI Automation – Selenide for Java. In other languages the sky is not so blue and clean. :) But world is changing and today we are meeting Selene – its alternative in Python. Selene also gathered ideas from other popular selenium framework in Java – html elements, which gives ability to construct your own custom elements in addition to simple WebElements. Let`s define the key features that make an abstract selenium wrapper really effective and will see how to use them with Selene in Python.

## Main features

* Concise API for Selenium
* jQuery-style selectors
* Ajax support
* PageObjects support
* Automatic driver management

Tests with Selene can be built either in a simple straightforward 'selenide' style or with PageObjects composed from Widgets i.e. reusable element components.
